After slaying Phantom Gonandarf, the entrance to a temple inexplicably reveals itself. I don't
know, maybe he had the garage door opener in his pocket or something. A ghostly garage door
opener. In a medieval fantasy game.<p>
...yeah that's probably right.<p>
Either way, the door's open now, so you'd best get inside, right? Going into the nearest door
that randomly opened is usually what protagonists in games do, so...get to it.<p>
