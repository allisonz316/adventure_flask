Wow you sure replaced that new sword with another new sword awfully quickly. It's almost like
that one Legend of Zolda game where you have to constantly switch weapons because they keep breaking on
you for little to no reason. Fun times, right?<p>
...narrator bias aside, you've reached the center of the temple, which also happens to be the
lair of the beast, Kaleidoscope! The evil fiend whose name was derived from the plant boss
in Legend of Zolda: Wind Shaker that probably next to no one else knows the name of!<p>
I mean...it's completely original. In every way.<p>
...just go fight the darn thing.<p>
