After slaying Merph, the entrance to a temple inexplicably reveals itself. I don't
know, maybe Merph had the garage door opener in its pocket or something. You know, a medieval
garage opener, in...its...non-existent...pocket...?<p>
...this joke worked better on the other route.<p>
Either way, the door's open now, so you'd best get inside, right? Going into the nearest door
that randomly opened is usually what protagonists in games do, so...get to it.<p>
